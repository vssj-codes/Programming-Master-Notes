### Python Tutorial: Datetime Module - How to Work with Dates, Times, Timedeltas, and Timezones

#### Key Concepts:

- **Importing the Module**: 
  - `import datetime`
  
- **Naive vs. Aware DateTimes**:
  - **Naive DateTimes**: No timezone information, easier to work with if you don't need that level of detail.
  - **Aware DateTimes**: Include timezone info and daylight savings time details.
  
- **Creating Dates**:
  - Using `datetime.date`: 
    ```python
    import datetime
    d = datetime.date(2016, 7, 24)
    print(d)
    ```
  - Getting today’s date:
    ```python
    today = datetime.date.today()
    print(today)
    ```

- **Extracting Date Components**:
  - Year, Month, Day:
    ```python
    year = today.year
    month = today.month
    day = today.day
    ```

- **Day of the Week**:
  - Weekday (Monday is 0, Sunday is 6):
    ```python
    weekday = today.weekday()
    ```
  - ISO Weekday (Monday is 1, Sunday is 7):
    ```python
    iso_weekday = today.isoweekday()
    ```

- **Timedeltas**:
  - Creating a timedelta:
    ```python
    delta = datetime.timedelta(days=7)
    ```
  - Adding/Subtracting Timedeltas:
    ```python
    next_week = today + delta
    last_week = today - delta
    ```

- **Datetime Objects**:
  - Combining date and time:
    ```python
    dt = datetime.datetime(2016, 7, 26, 12, 30, 45)
    print(dt)
    ```
  - Extracting Components:
    ```python
    date_part = dt.date()
    time_part = dt.time()
    hour = dt.hour
    minute = dt.minute
    ```

- **Current DateTime**:
  - Current local date and time:
    ```python
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    ```

- **Using Time Zones with `pytz`**:
  - Installing `pytz`:
    ```sh
    pip install pytz
    ```
  - Creating timezone aware datetime:
    ```python
    import pytz
    utc_dt = datetime.datetime(2016, 7, 26, 12, 30, 45, tzinfo=pytz.UTC)
    print(utc_dt)
    ```
  - Converting to different timezone:
    ```python
    mt = pytz.timezone('US/Mountain')
    mt_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(mt)
    print(mt_dt)
    ```

- **Formatting DateTime**:
  - ISO format:
    ```python
    iso_format = dt.isoformat()
    ```
  - Custom format using `strftime`:
    ```python
    formatted = dt.strftime('%B %d, %Y')
    print(formatted)
    ```

- **Parsing Strings to DateTime**:
  - Using `strptime`:
    ```python
    dt_str = 'July 26, 2016'
    dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(dt_str, '%B %d, %Y')
    print(dt)
    ```

### Python Tutorial: Context Managers - Efficiently Managing Resources

**Key Insights:**

- **Introduction to Context Managers:**
  - Context managers help manage resources in Python, automating setup and teardown processes.
  - Commonly used with file handling, but applicable to databases, locks, etc.

- **Using Context Managers with File Handling:**
  - Recommended way to handle files: use `with` statement for automatic resource management.
  - Example:
    ```python
    with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('Hello, World!')
    # File is automatically closed after the block
    ```

- **Creating Custom Context Managers with Classes:**
  - Define `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods in a class to handle setup and teardown.
  - Example:
    ```python
    class OpenFile:
        def __init__(self, file_name, mode):
            self.file_name = file_name
            self.mode = mode
        
        def __enter__(self):
            self.file = open(self.file_name, self.mode)
            return self.file
        
        def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
            self.file.close()

    with OpenFile('file.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('Hello, World!')
    ```

- **Creating Custom Context Managers with Functions:**
  - Use the `contextlib` module and the `@contextmanager` decorator.
  - Example:
    ```python
    from contextlib import contextmanager
    
    @contextmanager
    def open_file(file_name, mode):
        file = open(file_name, mode)
        try:
            yield file
        finally:
            file.close()
    
    with open_file('file.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('Hello, World!')
    ```

- **Practical Example - Directory Management:**
  - Context manager to handle changing directories.
  - Example:
    ```python
    from contextlib import contextmanager
    import os
    
    @contextmanager
    def change_dir(destination):
        current_dir = os.getcwd()
        os.chdir(destination)
        try:
            yield
        finally:
            os.chdir(current_dir)
    
    with change_dir('sample_directory'):
        # Do something in sample_directory
        print(os.listdir('.'))
    ```

- **Handling Errors with Context Managers:**
  - Use `try` and `finally` blocks to ensure resources are always released, even if an error occurs.
  - Example integrated in function-based context manager.

**Summary:**
- Context managers provide a clean and efficient way to manage resources in Python.
- They automate setup and teardown processes, reducing the chance of resource leaks.
- Custom context managers can be created using either classes or functions with the `@contextmanager` decorator.
- Practical examples include file handling and directory management, demonstrating the flexibility and utility of context managers.

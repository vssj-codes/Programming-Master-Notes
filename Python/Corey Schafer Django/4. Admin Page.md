## Python Django Tutorial: Full-Featured Web App Part 4 - Admin Page

### Key Insights

- **Accessing the Admin Page**:
  - The admin page is accessible by navigating to `/admin` after starting the development server.
  - Initially, there are no default admin users, so an admin user needs to be created.

- **Creating a Super User**:
  - Stop the development server and run the following command to create a super user:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
  - If an error occurs indicating that no such table exists, it means the database hasn't been created yet.

- **Running Migrations**:
  - Migrations are required to set up the database. Run the following commands:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

- **Super User Creation**:
  - After running migrations, re-run the super user creation command:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
  - Enter the required details (username, email, password) when prompted.

- **Logging into the Admin Page**:
  - Start the development server again:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
  - Use the created super user's credentials to log into the admin page.

- **Admin Interface**:
  - The default Django admin page allows for easy management of backend data.
  - Admin page displays sections like "Groups" and "Users" for managing user permissions and other settings.
  
- **Creating and Editing Users**:
  - You can create new users by navigating to the "Add user" section in the admin interface.
  - Users can be assigned different statuses such as active, staff, or super user.
  - Django securely hashes passwords and never stores raw passwords.

### Code Snippets

- **Creating a Super User**:
  ```bash

    ```

### Summary

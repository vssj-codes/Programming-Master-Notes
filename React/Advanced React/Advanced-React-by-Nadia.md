# Chapter-1-Intro-to-Re-renders

## 1.1-What-triggers-re-renders?

- **State updates** trigger re-renders, starting at the component holding the state.
- Props changes alone **do not** trigger re-renders (unless memoized with React.memo).

## 1.2-How-re-renders-propagate?

- React re-renders the component where state changed and all nested children **below** it in the component tree.
- React does **not** re-render upward or sibling components.

## 1.3-The-big-re-renders-myth

- ‚ÄúComponent re-renders when its props change‚Äù ‚Äî **FALSE** by default.
- React re-renders on state change; props only matter for memoized components.

## 1.4-Moving-state-down-pattern

- Move state into the smallest subcomponent that actually needs it.
- Isolates re-rendering to a smaller part of the tree, improving performance.
- Example: extract modal button and dialog into own component with its own state.

## 1.5-Danger-of-custom-hooks

- Custom hooks encapsulate state internally.
- State changes inside custom hooks cause re-render of **parent component using the hook**, even if the state is not used or returned directly.
- Be cautious where and how you use hooks to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

---

# Chapter-2-Elements,-Children-as-Props,-and-Re-renders

## 2.1-Core-concepts

- **Components** are functions or classes that return **Elements**.
- **Elements** are objects created by JSX that describe what to render.

## 2.2-Re-renders-and-passing-Elements-as-props

- Passing **Elements as props or children** from outside keeps those references **stable**.
- React compares these references with `Object.is()`. If the same, React **skips re-rendering** those children.
- This pattern helps isolate re-renders caused by internal state changes in the parent component.

## 2.3-Children-as-props-syntax-sugar

- `<Parent><Child /></Parent>` is the same as `<Parent children={<Child />} />`
- Using children is cleaner and idiomatic in JSX.

## 2.4-Scrollable-example-‚Äî-performance-tip

- Put scroll position state inside a small scroll handler component.
- Pass heavy/slow child components as props/children from outside.
- This prevents slow components from re-rendering on every scroll event.

## 2.5-Why-this-works

- React's reconciliation compares element references to decide re-rendering.
- Elements created outside don‚Äôt get re-created on every render ‚Üí stable reference.
- Elements created inside the component function get re-created every render ‚Üí new reference ‚Üí re-render.

## 2.6-Important-nuance:-Children-with-internal-state

- Even if children elements are passed as props and stable,
- Internal state updates inside those children still cause those children to re-render independently.

---

# Chapter-3-Configuration-Concerns-with-Elements-as-Props-‚öôÔ∏è‚ú®

## 3.1-Core-Idea

Instead of stuffing your components with a million tiny config props (`iconType`, `iconColor`, `isAvatar`, etc.), just **pass React elements as props**. This way, your component becomes a **configurable stage**, and the elements are the **stars**!


## 3.2-Examples-from-the-book-üìö

### 3.2.1-The-Flexible-Button

```jsx
const Button = ({ icon }) => <button>Submit {icon}</button>;

// Usage:
<Button icon={<Loading />} />
<Button icon={<Error color="red" />} />
<Button icon={<Warning color="yellow" size="large" />} />
<Button icon={<Avatar />} />
````

> _Think of Button as a pizza base ‚Äî you get to add whatever toppings you want!_ üçïüçÑüßÄ

### 3.2.2-The-cloneElement-Trap

```jsx
const clonedIcon = React.cloneElement(icon, { color: "gray" });
```

- **Warning!** This can **override user props** like `color="red"` unexpectedly.
    
- It‚Äôs like putting ketchup on a gourmet steak ‚Äî not everyone wants that! ü•©üçÖ
    

---

### 3.2.3-Conditional-Rendering-+-Element-Creation

```jsx
const footer = <Footer />;

const App = () => (isOpen ? <ModalDialog footer={footer} /> : null);
```

- The element `footer` is created **every render** but **not rendered** unless `isOpen` is true.
    
- Elements are cheap, like paper airplanes ‚Äî making one doesn‚Äôt cost much, but flying it (rendering) does! üõ©Ô∏è
    

---

### 3.3-Why-This-Pattern-Rocks-ü§ò

- **Cleaner APIs:** No prop explosion, just pass your custom elements.
    
- **Flexibility:** Full control to consumers to design icons or sections.
    
- **Composability:** Your components become Lego blocks ‚Äî mix and match freely! üß±‚ú®
    

---

### 3.4-Watch-Out-‚ö†Ô∏è

- `cloneElement` is fragile and can cause hard-to-debug bugs by overwriting props.
    
- Always memoize elements passed as props if created inside renders to prevent re-renders.
    

---

# Chapter-4-Advanced-Configuration-with-Render-Props-üß†

## 4.1-Core-concept

- Render props = function props used to **share state and logic** and customize rendering.
    
- Allows flexible, declarative UI composition without prop explosion.
    

---

## 4.2-Examples-Covered-(all-6)

### 4.2.1-MouseTracker-(basic-render-prop-example)

- Pass a function `render` to control how mouse position state is rendered.
    
- Example:
    
    ```jsx
    <MouseTracker
      render={({ x, y }) => (
        <p>
          ({x}, {y})
        </p>
      )}
    />
    ```
    

### 4.2.2-Render-Prop-as-Children

- Instead of a `render` prop, use children as a function:
    
    ```jsx
    <MouseTracker>
      {({ x, y }) => (
        <p>
          ({x}, {y})
        </p>
      )}
    </MouseTracker>
    ```
    

### 4.2.3-Sharing-Stateful-Logic-(Checkbox)

- Checkbox component uses render props to share its checked state and toggle logic with children.
    

### 4.2.4-Compound-Components-with-Render-Props

- Parent component manages state and passes it down via render props to multiple children for coordinated behavior.
    

### 4.2.5-Render-Prop-for-Controlled-Forms

- A render prop function is used to customize form rendering, passing form state and handlers to children.
    

### 4.2.6-Avoiding-Prop-Explosion

- Render props pattern used instead of many boolean/config props, keeping component APIs clean and flexible.
    

---

## 4.3-Important-points

- Render props are just functions passed as props or children.
    
- They give consumers full control to render whatever they want with the internal state/logic.
    
- Hooks can replace many render prop cases but knowing render props helps understand legacy code and design patterns.
    
- Be mindful of performance ‚Äî functions created inline cause re-renders if not memoized.
    

---

# Chapter-5-Memoization-with-useMemo,-useCallback,-and-React.memo

## 5.1-The-Problem:-Comparing-Values

- **JS compares primitive values (numbers, strings) by value.**
    
- **Objects, arrays, and functions are compared by reference.**
    
- New object/function creates new reference ‚Üí React considers props changed ‚Üí triggers re-render.
    
- This behavior causes many unnecessary re-renders in React apps.
    

**Rule #1:** Avoid creating new object/function props inline if they don't change.  
**Rule #2:** Use memoization hooks (`useMemo`, `useCallback`) to keep stable references.  
**Rule #3:** Be mindful of how values are passed down component trees.

---

## 5.2-useMemo-and-useCallback:-How-They-Work

- **useMemo:** Memoizes a **computed value**.
    
    - Recomputes only when dependencies change.
        
    - Saves expensive calculations on each render.
        
    - Syntax:
        
        ```jsx
        const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(a, b), [a, b]);
        ```
        
- **useCallback:** Memoizes a **function**.
    
    - Returns same function instance unless dependencies change.
        
    - Useful when passing functions as props to avoid re-renders.
        
    - Syntax:
        
        ```jsx
        const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => doSomething(x), [x]);
        ```
        

---

## 5.3-Antipattern:-Memoizing-Props

- **Memoizing all props blindly is harmful.**
    
- It increases complexity and CPU overhead unnecessarily.
    
- Many times, memoization provides no benefit for cheap calculations.
    
- **Only memoize:**
    
    - Expensive calculations or functions.
        
    - Props passed to memoized components to keep references stable.
        

---

## 5.4-What-is-React.memo

- `React.memo` is a **Higher-Order Component (HOC)**.
    
- It **wraps functional components** to skip re-render if props are shallowly equal.
    
- Helps improve performance by preventing unnecessary rendering.
    
- Default shallow compare compares:
    
    - Primitives by value.
        
    - Objects/functions by reference.
        
- Usage:
    
    ```jsx
    const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(Component);
    ```
    

---

## 5.5-React.memo-and-Props-from-Props

- React.memo works only if **all props have stable references**.
    
- If new object/function props are passed every render ‚Üí React.memo won‚Äôt help.
    
- To fix, use `useMemo` or `useCallback` in parent to memoize these props.
    
- Beware of inline objects/functions as they create new references each time.
    

---

## 5.6-React.memo-and-Children

- Passing JSX elements as children creates **new references every render**.
    
- This causes React.memo to fail memoization and re-render.
    
- To optimize:
    
    - Memoize children components.
        
    - Avoid creating new elements inline inside render.
        
    - Or use render props to pass functions instead of elements.
        

---

## 5.7-React.memo-and-Memoized-Children-(Almost)

- Even memoized children components can cause re-render if their **props change**.
    
- React.memo compares all props shallowly, including children.
    
- Use memoization at **all levels** to ensure stable props and children.
    
- Deeply nested components require careful prop memoization to fully benefit.
    

---

## 5.8-useMemo-and-Expensive-Calculations

- Expensive operations (sorting, filtering, heavy math) should be memoized.
    
- `useMemo` caches calculation and recalculates only when dependencies change.
    
- Avoid running heavy calculations on every render.
    
- Example:
    
    ```jsx
    const sortedList = useMemo(() => list.sort(compareFn), [list]);
    ```
    
- Memoizing cheap calculations is counterproductive.
    

---

## 5.9-Key-Takeaways-and-Rules-Summary

- **Rule #1:** Avoid inline objects/functions in props; memoize them if necessary.
    
- **Rule #2:** Use `React.memo` to optimize functional components with stable props.
    
- **Rule #3:** Memoize expensive calculations with `useMemo`; memoize callbacks with `useCallback`.
    
- **Rule #4:** Memoization adds overhead; use it wisely and only when needed.
    
- Memoization is a **performance optimization tool**, not a silver bullet.
    
- Debug and profile to identify real bottlenecks before memoizing.
    

---

### Bonus:-Common-Pitfall-Example

- Passing `data={{ id: '1' }}` inline causes a new object each render ‚Üí breaks React.memo deeper in the tree.
    
- Solution:
    
    ```jsx
    const memoizedData = useMemo(() => ({ id: "1" }), []);
    <Component data={memoizedData} />;
    ```

# **Chapter 6: Deep Dive into Diffing and Reconciliation**

## 6.1-The-Mysterious-Bug

- **The Bug**: When conditionally rendering components (like showing a company tax ID input), React may unmount and mount components.
    
- **Re-rendering behavior**: If state changes from false to true, the **old component unmounts**, and the **new component mounts**.
    
- **State loss**: If you type in the input field and toggle the checkbox, the text gets lost because the input component‚Äôs state is reset on remount.
    

---

## 6.2-Diffing-and-Reconciliation

- **Reconciliation**: React compares the old and new virtual DOM to determine what to update in the actual DOM.
    
- **Key concept**: React **does not deeply compare** the elements. It compares by reference.
    
- **What triggers a re-render?**: React will re-render if the **reference to the element changes**. If the type of the element remains the same but the reference changes, React will update it.
    

---

## 6.3-Why-We-Can‚Äôt-Define-Components-Inside-Other-Components

- **Breaking reconciliation**: Defining components inside other components can cause React to lose the original reference, leading to unnecessary re-mounts.
    

---

## 6.4-Reconciliation-and-Arrays

- **Handling arrays**: React can efficiently update lists when the **`key` attribute is used**.
    
- **Performance**: Always use **`key`** for lists to ensure React identifies elements correctly and prevents inefficient updates.
    

---

## 6.5-Why-`key`-is-Important

- **Optimizes rendering**: The `key` helps React to match elements and avoid unnecessary re-renders when the list changes.
    
- **State resets**: Changing the `key` forces React to reset the state of the component, which can be useful when you want to remount the component (but may cause performance issues).
    

---

## 6.6-Using-`key`-to-Force-Reuse-of-an-Element

- **Force reuse**: The `key` attribute can be used strategically to force React to reuse elements, preventing unnecessary state resets or DOM manipulations.
    
- **Not always necessary**: `key` is primarily needed for dynamic lists and not static elements.
    

---

## 6.7-Performance-and-Best-Practices

- **Minimize component nesting**: Reducing unnecessary nested components helps improve performance.
    
- **Efficient rendering**: Use the `key` attribute for arrays, avoid changing keys unnecessarily, and keep components simple to improve React‚Äôs reconciliation process.
    

---

## 6.8-Key-Takeaways

- **Diffing and reconciliation**: React efficiently updates the DOM by comparing the virtual DOM trees before and after the update.
    
- **Using keys correctly**: Keys are critical for performance and to prevent unexpected re-renders in dynamic lists.
    
- **Component structure**: Avoid unnecessary nested components to improve reconciliation efficiency.

---

# Chapter 7: Higher-Order Components in the Modern World

## 7.1-What-is-a-Higher-Order-Component-(HOC)?

- **Definition**: A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component, adds logic or behavior to it, and returns a new enhanced component.
- **Purpose**: HOCs are used for code reuse, logic encapsulation, and enhancing components without modifying their internal implementation.
- **Structure of an HOC**:
  ```jsx
  const withSomeLogic = (Component) => {
    return (props) => <Component {...props} />;
  };
```

## 7.2-Common-Use-Cases-for-HOCs

- **Enhancing callbacks**: Add logic to callbacks like `onClick`, `onChange`, etc.
    
    - Example: Add logging or analytics to track user interactions with components.
        
- **Injecting props**: Modify props before passing them to the wrapped component.
    
    - Example: Inject theme or user information into a component.
        
- **Enhancing lifecycle methods**: You can enhance or modify lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`) in the wrapped component.
    

## 7.3-Example:-Enhancing-Callbacks

- **Problem**: Need to log user clicks across multiple components.
    
- **Without HOC**: Add logging manually to each component.
    
- **With HOC**: Use an HOC to inject logging functionality dynamically.
    
    ```jsx
    const withLoggingOnClick = (Component) => {
      return (props) => {
        const onClick = () => {
          console.log('Button clicked!');
          props.onClick(); // Call the original onClick
        };
        return <Component {...props} onClick={onClick} />;
      };
    };
    ```
    

## 7.4-Intercepting-DOM-Events

- **Global Event Handling**: Use HOCs to attach global event listeners, such as keypress events or mouse events, across components.
    
- **Example**: A modal component that intercepts keypress events to close when the user presses "Escape":
    
    ```jsx
    const withEscapeKeyHandler = (Component) => {
      return (props) => {
        useEffect(() => {
          const onKeyDown = (event) => {
            if (event.key === 'Escape') {
              props.onClose();
            }
          };
          window.addEventListener('keydown', onKeyDown);
          return () => {
            window.removeEventListener('keydown', onKeyDown);
          };
        }, []);
        return <Component {...props} />;
      };
    };
    ```
    

## 7.5-When-to-Avoid-HOCs

- **Overuse of HOCs**: With the introduction of React hooks, many use cases for HOCs have been replaced with more readable and maintainable hook-based solutions.
    
- **Component Reusability**: HOCs can sometimes make components harder to test and debug, especially when they are chained together.
    

## 7.6-HOCs-and-React-Hooks

- **Before Hooks**: HOCs were the primary way to add logic or modify components in React.
    
- **After Hooks**: Hooks like `useEffect` and `useState` now provide simpler, more flexible alternatives.
    
- **HOC Benefits**:
    
    - Reusable logic (e.g., logging, theme, or analytics).
        
    - Enhances the component without modifying its core logic.
        
- **Best Practice**: Use HOCs for cross-cutting concerns (e.g., authentication, theming) but prefer hooks for most other cases.
    

## 7.7-Code-Splitting-with-HOCs

- **Dynamic Imports**: HOCs are often used with **React.lazy** to split large components into smaller chunks and only load them when needed.
    
- **Example**: Wrap components with `React.lazy` for dynamic loading:
    
    ```jsx
    const withLazyLoad = (importFunc) => {
      return React.lazy(importFunc);
    };
    ```
    

## 7.8-Key-Takeaways

- **HOCs** are useful for enhancing components with additional logic, like logging or handling lifecycle methods, and for injecting props.
    
- **HOCs replace props** and **modify behavior**, while **React hooks** offer a simpler and more declarative approach for managing component logic.
    
- **When to use HOCs**: Use them for code reuse, cross-cutting concerns, and component enhancement without modifying the original component‚Äôs behavior.
    
- **When not to use HOCs**: Avoid overcomplicating component logic with too many HOCs, especially when hooks provide a better alternative.

# Chapter 8: React Context and Performance

## 8.1-The-Problem

- **Context** often has a bad reputation for causing unnecessary re-renders, with some developers avoiding it entirely.
    
- **Performance Issues**: Context value changes trigger re-renders for **all consumers** of that Context, potentially impacting performance.
    

## 8.2-How-Context-Can-Help

- **Global State Management**: Context allows you to share values without prop drilling, improving the structure and performance of your app when used correctly.
    
- **Alternative to Prop Drilling**: It can simplify passing data between deeply nested components.
    

## 8.3-Context-Value-Change

- **Re-render Trigger**: Every time a value in the Context provider changes, **all consumers** that use this Context re-render.
    
- **Impact**: This can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially in large apps with frequent Context value updates.
    

## 8.4-Preventing-Unnecessary-Context-Re-renders

- **Split Providers**: Divide large Context providers into smaller ones to isolate changes and limit the scope of re-renders.
    
    - **Example**: Using multiple Context providers for independent state management (e.g., navigation state, user data).
        
- **Memoizing Context Values**: Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to memoize the Context value, preventing unnecessary re-renders when the Context value changes.
    
    - **Example**:
        
        ```jsx
        const value = useMemo(() => ({ isNavExpanded, toggle }), [isNavExpanded, toggle]);
        ```
        

## 8.5-Using-Reducers-with-Split-Providers

- **`useReducer` for Complex State**: Combining Context with `useReducer` helps manage complex state within the provider while still optimizing re-renders.
    

## 8.6-Context-Selectors

- **Imitate Selectors**: Context doesn‚Äôt have built-in selectors, but you can implement them using **higher-order components (HOCs)** and **React.memo** to prevent re-renders when irrelevant state changes.
    

## 8.7-Key-Takeaways

- **Context Re-renders**: Be cautious as Context re-renders every consumer when the value changes.
    
- **Optimization Techniques**: Memoizing Context values and splitting large Context providers are effective ways to improve performance.
    
- **Consider External State Management**: For large applications, consider using a state management library like Redux for better optimization, especially when selectors are needed.

# Chapter 9: Refs: From Storing Data to Imperative API

## 9.1-Accessing-the-DOM-in-React

- **Why we need Refs**: React abstracts away direct DOM manipulation, but there are still rare cases where direct DOM access is necessary (e.g., focusing an input, shaking an element, measuring sizes).
- **Common use cases**:
  - Manually focusing an element (e.g., form inputs).
  - Detecting clicks outside components (e.g., for modals).
  - Scrolling to a specific element.
  - Measuring component sizes.

## 9.2-What-is-Ref?

- **Definition**: A **Ref** is a **mutable object** created using `useRef()`, which persists across re-renders.
- **Difference between Ref and State**: 
  - **State** updates trigger re-renders; **Ref** updates do not.
  - Refs can store **anything**‚ÄîDOM nodes, values, or functions.

## 9.3-Ref-Update-Doesn't-Trigger-Re-render

- **Ref updates are synchronous and do not trigger re-renders**, making them useful for **storing mutable data** without affecting the component's visual output.
- **Example**: A form that uses a ref to store the value of an input without causing re-renders on each keystroke.
  ```jsx
  const ref = useRef();
  const onChange = (e) => { ref.current = e.target.value; };
```

- **Drawback**: If you need to **render changes** based on a ref value (like showing a character count), you can't do that with refs, as their updates don‚Äôt trigger re-renders.
    

## 9.4-Assigning-DOM-Elements-to-Ref

- **How to use Refs with DOM elements**:
    
    - Attach a ref to a DOM element using the `ref` attribute:
        
        ```jsx
        const inputRef = useRef();
        <input ref={inputRef} />
        ```
        

## 9.5-Passing-Ref-from-Parent-to-Child

- **Passing Refs as Props**: Refs can be passed from parent to child components as regular props.
    
- **Forwarding Refs**: Use `forwardRef` to pass the ref to a child component:
    
    ```jsx
    const Input = forwardRef((props, ref) => <input ref={ref} {...props} />);
    ```
    

## 9.6-Imperative-API-with-useImperativeHandle

- **Purpose**: `useImperativeHandle` allows you to customize the instance value that‚Äôs exposed when a ref is passed to a child component.
    
    ```jsx
    useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
      focus: () => { inputRef.current.focus(); },
      shake: () => { /* shake logic */ },
    }));
    ```
    
- **Alternative**: You can manually mutate the `ref.current` object in a `useEffect` to implement imperative logic without using `useImperativeHandle`.
    

## 9.7-Imperative-API-without-useImperativeHandle

- **Manual approach**: Instead of using `useImperativeHandle`, you can directly mutate `ref.current` to expose imperative methods:
    
    ```jsx
    const InputField = ({ apiRef }) => {
      useEffect(() => {
        apiRef.current = {
          focus: () => { /* focus logic */ },
          shake: () => { /* shake logic */ },
        };
      }, [apiRef]);
    };
    ```
    

## 9.8-Key-Takeaways

- **Refs are mutable** objects that persist between renders, useful for storing values, DOM elements, or functions.
    
- **Ref updates don't trigger re-renders**, which is useful for performance but limits their use for UI-driven logic.
    
- **Imperative logic** can be exposed via `useImperativeHandle` or manual mutation of `ref.current`.
    
- **`forwardRef`** is needed when passing refs to child components in functional components.

# Chapter 10: Closures in React

## 10.1-The-Problem

- **Closures** in JavaScript: Functions that capture their surrounding environment.
    
- **Stale closure**: When the closure "captures" the state or props at the moment it‚Äôs created and doesn‚Äôt update after that.
    

### Example:

- A form with a callback, like `onClick`, is passed into a memoized component, but the callback captures **stale state** and logs `undefined` instead of the current state.
    



## 10.2-What-Are-Closures?

- **Definition**: A closure is a function that has access to its **own scope**, the **enclosing function‚Äôs scope**, and the **global scope**.
    
- **Closure Example**:
    
    ```javascript
    const something = () => {
      const value = 'text';
      const inside = () => {
        console.log(value); // inside can access value
      };
    };
    ```
    



## 10.3-The-Stale-Closure-Problem

- **Stale closure** occurs when a function "captures" state/props and **does not update** them on re-renders.
    
- **Common scenario**: Using `useCallback` or `useMemo` incorrectly, causing the callback to use old state values instead of the latest.



## 10.4-Stale-Closures-in-React

- **`useCallback`**: When dependencies are missing, the closure doesn't update, and it retains outdated values (like state).
    
    ```javascript
    const onClick = useCallback(() => {
      console.log(state); // Might log outdated state if not properly handled
    }, []); // Missing state in dependency array
    ```
    
- **`useMemo`**: Same issue occurs with `useMemo` when the dependencies aren‚Äôt correctly defined.



## 10.5-Stale-Closures-in-Refs

- **Refs and Stale Closures**: Passing a function to a `useRef` doesn‚Äôt trigger an update unless the ref is explicitly updated in a `useEffect`.
    
    - **Problem**: The function is only set once, and it won‚Äôt update on state changes unless explicitly mutated.
        
    - **Fix**: Use `useEffect` to update the ref when state or props change:
        
        ```javascript
        const ref = useRef();
        useEffect(() => {
          ref.current = () => {
            console.log(state);
          };
        }, [state]);
        ```



## 10.6-Stale-Closures-in-`React.memo`

- **Memoization issue**: If `React.memo` is used with a callback, the callback might never update due to memoization and will always carry the stale closure.
    
- **Fix**: Add custom comparison logic to `React.memo` or ensure that the function has access to the latest state by using `useCallback`.



## 10.7-Escaping-the-Closure-Trap-with-Refs

- **Solution**: Use `useRef` to store the function, which can access the latest state through `ref.current`. This avoids the closure problem and keeps the function stable without re-creating it.
    
    - **Implementation**:
        
        ```javascript
        const ref = useRef();
        useEffect(() => {
          ref.current = () => {
            console.log(state); // Always accesses the latest state
          };
        }, [state]);
        ```



## 10.8-Key-Takeaways

- **Closures capture the state at the time of creation**‚Äîleading to stale closures when that state changes.
    
- **`useCallback` and `useMemo`** can help avoid unnecessary re-creations but may cause stale closures if dependencies are not managed correctly.
    
- **`useRef`** can store functions that need access to the latest state or props without re-creating them on each render.
    
- **Properly managing dependencies** and **mutating refs** are essential strategies to escape stale closure traps in React.
